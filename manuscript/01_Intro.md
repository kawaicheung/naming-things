# Introduction

Here's a little insight into what I'm thinking about when I write code.

So, I'm working on--what I'll call for now--a data migration feature. It's for a new version of a product I helped create ten years ago called DoneDone. It's an issue tracking and customer support tool. For the past handful of years, I've been its sole developer. Being the lone developer on a product for that long has some drawbacks, but, for someone like me, I crave this kind of quiet, sustained work--like a scupltor chiseling away at this large piece of stone.

Anyways, here I am working on this data migration feature. The goal is to give users an easy way to bring their existing data over from the old version of DoneDone over to this new version. I certainly wished the process was as straightforward as mapping the columns and tables from the old database over to the new database, but it's not. The new DoneDone is markedly different than its predecessor. Some data maps simply, other data requires some massaging, and still others simply can't be mapped at all.

For about six days, I'm working on this feature--the whole bit. There are a few screens to design and develop, a way to login to the old system, a way to let users choose the projects
